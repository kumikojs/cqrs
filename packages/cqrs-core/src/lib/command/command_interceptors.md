# Command Interceptors

Command interceptors are a powerful feature in the CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) pattern that allow you to intercept and modify commands before they are executed. They provide a way to add cross-cutting concerns, such as logging, validation, authorization, and caching, to your command execution pipeline.

## How Command Interceptors Work

Command interceptors work by intercepting commands at various stages of the command execution pipeline. When a command is received, it goes through a series of interceptors, each of which can modify the command or perform additional actions before passing it on to the next interceptor or the command handler.

The command interceptor pipeline typically consists of the following stages:

1. **Pre-processing**: Interceptors in this stage can perform tasks such as input validation, authorization checks, and logging. They can modify the command or throw an exception to abort the command execution.
2. **Command Handling**: The command is passed to the command handler, which is responsible for executing the command logic and producing the desired side effects.
3. **Post-processing**: Interceptors in this stage can perform tasks such as caching, auditing, and sending notifications. They can also modify the command result or throw an exception to handle errors or enforce business rules.

## Benefits of Using Command Interceptors

Using command interceptors offers several benefits:

- **Separation of Concerns**: Command interceptors allow you to separate cross-cutting concerns from the core command logic, making your code more modular and maintainable.
- **Reusability**: Interceptors can be reused across multiple commands, reducing code duplication and promoting consistency.
- **Flexibility**: Interceptors provide a flexible way to add or remove functionality from the command execution pipeline without modifying the core command logic.
- **Testability**: Interceptors can be easily unit tested in isolation, ensuring that they behave correctly and don't introduce regressions.

## Getting Started

To use command interceptors in your application, follow these steps:

1. Define your command interceptor classes, implementing the necessary interfaces or extending the base interceptor class.
2. Configure the command interceptor pipeline by registering the interceptors in the appropriate order.
3. Apply the necessary attributes or annotations to your commands to enable interception.
4. Test your command interceptors to ensure they behave as expected.

For more detailed information on how to implement and use command interceptors, refer to the documentation or examples provided by your CQRS framework or library.

## Conclusion

Command interceptors are a valuable tool for adding cross-cutting concerns to your command execution pipeline. By intercepting and modifying commands at various stages, you can enhance the functionality, reusability, and maintainability of your application.

Remember to consult the documentation and examples specific to your CQRS framework or library for more detailed guidance on using command interceptors effectively.
